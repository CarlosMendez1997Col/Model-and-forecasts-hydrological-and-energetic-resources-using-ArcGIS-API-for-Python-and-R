# Models and forecasts hydrological and energetic resources using ArcGIS API for Python and R

## Description

Modeling and forecasting in hydrological resources and energy using the `LSTM (long short-term memory)` and `ResCNN` neural networks, in ArcGIS API for Python and R.

Each section is described below:

* The first section, indicate how to create a Neural Network Auto Regression (NNAR) in R.
* The second and third sections, explain how to create a `LSTM (long short-term memory)` and `ResCNN` neural networks in ArcGIS API for Python
* The fourth section, share the Data, Time Series and Graphs used in this repository

## Prerequisites and libraries

## Data acquisition and download

### The data used for build the time series and the LSTM and ResCNN neural networks, include information about 3 Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP):

* Data
* Useful Volume
* Useful Volume Percent (%)
* Affluent Flow
* Defluent Flow
* Natural Flow
* Stored Energy 
* Affluent Natural Energy
* Energy Generation

Data processed in time series formats are available at:
